# MLC-ARC_gym
Evaluating MLC method on ARC_gym

MLC stands for "Meta-Learning Compositionally", a method based on Transformers and meta-learning. The related paper is: [Human-like systematic generalization
through a meta-learning neural network](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06668-3.pdf), by Lake & Baroni (2023).

Code for the MLC algorithm is taken from : https://github.com/brendenlake/MLC-ML

To use the code, you must install ARC_gym: https://github.com/SimonOuellette35/ARC_gym
